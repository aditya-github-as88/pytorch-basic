Pytorch vs Numpy

Numpy algo are mainly used for
1) K Means ( Clustering algo)
2) Decision Tree

While Pytorch is used for 
1) Heavy Matrix computation
2) Most commonly used for Deep Learning frameworks( used for neural networks , multiple layers( ~150))

Another major difference is tensors are supported by accelerator memory such as GPU( faster processing speed)

why use GPU? graphic processing unit

CUDA made by NVidea

what is CUDA??
Parallel computing platform and programming model that accelerates deep learning and other compute-intensive apps by taking advantage of the parallel processing power of GPUs.	
other competotors are AMD but when CUDA combines with NVIDEA GPU, speed is fast

GPU is good in computing specialized computation --> CPU is good in handling general computation

speed of GPU depends upon the type of computation being performed , what kind of computation is mostly GPU used for --> parallel computation

Parallel computation
broken down into smaller cmputation --> smaller then sycnronized into single --> this again depends upon cored in the hardware( CPU may have ~8-16 cores but GPU has ~1000 of cores)

role of GPU in neural networks
